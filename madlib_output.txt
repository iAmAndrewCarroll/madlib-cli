Don't Drink the Water in Tulum

I the asdf and asdf asdf

Don't even brush your asdf with a asdf asdf brush. The water in Tulum will literally make you asdf your pants.  You'll end up trying to clean yourself up with a asdf towel.  I'm just sharing the wisdom I asdf while I was visiting Tulum.  Don't be like me.  Keep your britches sdf.
