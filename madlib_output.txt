Don't Drink the Water in Tulum

I the asd and as asd

Don't even brush your ads with a ads ads brush. The water in Tulum will literally make you dsa your pants.  You'll end up trying to clean yourself up with a sda towel.  I'm just sharing the wisdom I sad while I was visiting Tulum.  Don't be like me.  Keep your britches asd.
